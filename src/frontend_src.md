# Tauri SRC Frontend Documentation

This document explains the key role of the main entry files of the application: App.jsx, main.jsx, and App.css.

# 1. App.jsx

The App.jsx file serves as the top-level component of your React application. It wraps your main content in the necessary context providers (for example, the AppContext) so that the entire application can access shared state and functionality. Typically, it looks similar to:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { AppProvider } from "./contexts/AppContext";
import Main from "./Main";

function App() {
  return (
    <AppProvider>
      <Main />
    </AppProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```
## Key Points:

- Context Wrapping: The AppProvider wraps the component tree to provide access to global state and functions.
  
- Main Component: The Main component (or equivalent) contains the main UI and routing structure.

# 2. main.jsx

The main.jsx file is the entry point for rendering your React app into the DOM. It initializes the root component and applies global CSS styling by importing the App.css file. An example implementation could be:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import "./App.css";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
## Key Points:

- Rendering: It uses ReactDOM.createRoot to render the top-level <App /> component into a DOM node (typically with the id "root").

- Global Styles: Importing App.css applies global CSS styles to the application.

- Strict Mode: React.StrictMode is used to help detect potential issues in the application during development.

# 3. App.css

The App.css file contains global CSS styles and class definitions used throughout the application. It is imported once in the main.jsx to ensure consistent styling across all components.

This documentation should help you understand how the main structural files in your Tauri application work together to render the UI and apply global state and styling.
